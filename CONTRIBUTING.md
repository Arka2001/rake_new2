Looking to contribute to this project ? All valid PRs are welcome.

Follow these steps to set your local repository up and start contributing :

#### NOTE : 
Make sure before you start making changes locally, you pull the code from the upstream everytime to make sure your local repository (remote) is even with the original repository (upstream).
Command to pull code : ```git pull origin <BRANCH_NAME>```  (For now, the branch name will be ```main```)

### BUT I'VE MADE THE CHANGES. WHAT NEXT ?
NOTE : It is preferred that you create a new branch for every change that you make. It is NOT advisable to make changes on the master branch itself.

Steps to create a new branch :

1. Checkout to a new branch : ```git checkout -b <APPRORIATE_NAME>```  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE : The branch name must follow these conventions                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                         
1. Branch name must be in lowercase.                                                                                                    
2. Branch name must contain only letters, digits and dashes/underscores.                                                                 
3. Branch name must be short and give an idea as to what change you're going to make. E.g. : ```git checkout -b update-readme```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

2. Make the changes on that branch.
3. To make a PR, just follow these steps :

    a. Stage your changes : ```git add .```
    
    b. Commit your changes : ```git commit -m "<proper commit message>"```
    
    c. Push them to your forked repository : ```git push origin <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>```
    
    d. Go to your forked repository and refresh, you'll receive a prompt to create a PR. Make sure you write a proper PR description, else, your PR will be rejected.
    
    e. Wait for the maintainer to review your PR.
